**Snippets for Flutter** provides a collection of clean and reusable code templates designed to help you build Flutter apps faster and more efficiently.  
This extension includes ready-to-use snippets for both **Stateless** and **Stateful Widgets**, with and without `AdaptativeScaffold`, making your development process smoother and more productive.

## âœ¨ Features

- ðŸš€ Quickly generate Flutter widget boilerplates with a few keystrokes.  
- ðŸ§± Support for:
  - `StatelessWidget` (with or without `AdaptativeScaffold`)
  - `StatefulWidget` (with private or public state)
  - Scaffold or AdaptativeScaffold base
- ðŸª„ Automatic **PascalCase** class naming based on the file name (e.g. `home_page.dart` â†’ `HomePage`).
- âœ¨ Clean indentation and code formatting.
- ðŸ§­ Consistent structure that aligns with Flutter best practices.

## ðŸ’» Snippet Examples

Typing `fstless` in a Dart file will generate:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatelessWidget {
	const HomePage({super.key});

	@override
	Widget build(BuildContext context){
		return Scaffold(
			body: Center(child: Text('Hello World')),
		);
	}
}
```

Typing `fpastful` in a Dart file will generate:

```dart
class HomePage extends StatefulWidget {
	const HomePage({ super.key });

	@override
	State<HomePage> createState() => _HomePageState();
}

class _HomePageState extends State<HomePage> {
	@override
	Widget build(BuildContext context) {
		return AdaptativeScaffold(
			body: Center(child: Text('Hello World')),
		);
	}
}
```
